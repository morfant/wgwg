**Prompt:**

Create SuperCollider code that defines a SynthDef and a Pdef based on the following parameters:

### Input

**Common**  
- Theme: cat's the way of love climate change 

**For SynthDef**  
- Final amplitude: around -6dB  
- Panning: stable  
- Main synthesis method: choose between [Rich Additive, Waveshaping, Sampling]  
- Reverberation: 20 out of 100  
- Highlight band: mid-high  
- Output bus number: 100

**For Pdef**  
- Pattern complexity: low  
- Repeat of each pattern class: less than 20 (never use `inf`!)  
- Number of parallel melody lines: 3  
- Number of notes per melody line: about 20  
- Melody sequence speed: mid tempo
- Scale concept: serialism

### Task

Using the above input, generate SuperCollider code that:
1. Use .add method to registers a SynthDef on the server.
2. Registers a Pdef pattern using that SynthDef as its instrument.

Wrap both the SynthDef and Pdef within a single parentheses block so they can be executed together. The Pdef should use the `.play` method at the end.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Name the SynthDef and Pdef the same (use English with proper capitalization).
- Ensure the repeat argument for pattern classes like `Pseq` in the `Pbind` is not `inf` and at least one pattern class has a repeat argument of less than 50.
- Avoid using `.add` at the end of the Pdef.
- `PmidiCps` class should not be used, and `Pseq` must include a non-empty collection.
- Ensure that any pattern classes like `Pseq` can not understand '.scramble' method.
- Don't use '.serial' method with Scale class.

- If you use `Demand`, avoid `inf` as the repeat count and ensure the `trig` argument is an audio-rate UGen.
- Define local variables with `var` at the beginning of the function.
- If a sample is needed, use `/Users/giy/WGWG/server/backend/static/sample.wav` as the file path.

### Output Format

- The entire output should be formatted as SuperCollider code inside a Markdown code block.
- On the first line, include the comment `// SynthDef` followed by the SynthDef's name on the next line as a comment.
- Ensure no `.add` method is used after Pdef, and avoid `PmidiCps`.
- Keep the complexity simple, with a stable but warm and loving theme throughout the sound.
